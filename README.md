Recognizing and acknowledging human emotions, especially in the context of end-of-life experiences. However, classifying emotions based on EEG signals poses a substantial challenge due to the intricate and ever-changing nature of brain activity linked to different emotional states. 
<br>
The primary objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of accurately classifying emotions by analyzing EEG signals collected from individuals in the end-of-life stage. Additionally, our research aims to visualize the underlying brain activity patterns associated with these emotions to gain deeper insights into this complex interplay.
<br>
Furthermore, this research can contribute to the broader understanding of emotions and their neural substrates, potentially impacting various fields such as psychology, healthcare, and communication.
